# This library shares all of the same requirements as Neutron
# and doesn't work without Neutron so we depend on Neutron to
# setup the requirements. If any packages are added that are
# specific to bsnstack lib, put them here.

# These repos are installed from git in OpenStack CI if the job
# configures them as required-projects:
tap-as-a-service>=3.0.0 # Apache-2.0
