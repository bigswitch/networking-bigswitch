# Neuron REST Proxy Plug-in for Big Switch and FloodLight Controllers

This module provides a generic neutron plugin 'NeutronRestProxy' that
translates neutron function calls to authenticated REST requests (JSON supported)
to a set of redundant external network controllers.

It also keeps a local persistent store of neutron state that has been
setup using that API.

Currently the FloodLight Openflow Controller or the Big Switch Networks Controller
can be configured as external network controllers for this plugin.
