# how to define in-repo zuul job to override the existing:
# https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/zuulv3.html#howto-add-an-in-repo-job
# current networking-bigswitch job defined at:
# https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/master/zuul.d/projects.yaml#L9095-L9101
# openstack-python-jobs-neutron has a required-projects field that specifies
# neutron - and by default, when zuul doesn't find a branch called
# stable/newton, it will checkout master - causing tox py27 failures.
# zuul doesn't use the branch as given in test-requirements.txt
# we override it by creating an in-repo zuul job to override-checkout for that
# project and specify the newton-eol.
# the format that we specify below is based on openstack-python-jobs-neutron:
# https://github.com/openstack-infra/openstack-zuul-jobs/blob/5f6d861f4316a09965ad3b96acf386b67ee1efee/zuul.d/project-templates.yaml#L340-L366
